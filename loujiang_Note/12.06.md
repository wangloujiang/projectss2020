# The progress, standpoint 12.06
idea: keep the progress together, solve the problem
## loujiang
1. integrate the edge detection method to the object. 
2. roughly check and refine the characters in the object method.
3. regenerate the features result of the old database and get the following result: with 15,without 15, without 15+ standard with z method, with 9 10 12 as one group 
4. generate the new database image features and get the rough result.
* _problem:_
1. the NIR data integration not here
2. the wrong data loss of the mass information in the new data,labeled out already
3. the method of the feature selection is not good --- feature 7 -- always 0.
4. the speed of the code.

1. code for regression finished
2. the NIR information >> 
* the consistent percentage
* new method: find the determinate wavelength (PCA/LDA selection) of the different classes.
* _problem_ 
1. the times integration
2. the average of the wavelength
3. the error of the remain is always different in PCA.
