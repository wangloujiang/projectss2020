# image analyzer 
1. integrate the edge detection method to the image analyzer.
2. change some feature selection method to fit the change of the detection method--- problem 1
3. generate the feature collection result for both database-- problem 2 and result 1 result 2
# NIR data processing
4. NIR collection: generate model for the Kaolin and CaCO3
5. Use the method into the newdata base to generate the point view of each group---result3,and problem3
# data processing 
6. the pca collection of the main features --- reduce the matrix from 25 to lower: result will become lower.
# problem
1. feature 7 -- always 0
2. data.scale some are not included in the new database-- we have the id and need the regeneration.
3. the CaCo3 percentage is negative! 
4. the run time of the collection features...
# result 
1. the old database : 71.5% with 15, 76.6% without 15, 76.8% without 15 + standard, 82.1% roughly get the 3 difficult group together.
2. the new database : 97.2% without the complete data from the old 
3. show the picture, the ingroup consistence-- ensured, the number correctness? not sure.
# plan
1. need the total data.-- generate the basic result for the new data.
2. try if use NIR data can get to some big group --- need very high prediction correctness-- then go to different detail group 

4. the change of the feature selection code.
5. new method: find the determinate wavelength (PCA/LDA selection) of the different classes.
